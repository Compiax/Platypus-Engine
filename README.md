Platypus-OCR
=====================

Split Bill is a cross-platform mobile application that serves to ease the process of splitting a restaurant bill when eating out with friends. Using OCR technology and the mobile camera, the app allows multiple users to join the session and on their own phones to claim, edit, add and delete items on the bill. The app shows the total of the user's claims and calculates a tip, completely removing the need for financial mathematics after a friendly meal.

The OCR is responsible for text recognition, bill interpretation and creation of JSON object that will be sent through to the API for further processing
